<P>There are two open-source projects available here.</P>
<P>The latest version of gnetman for gEDA is <A HREF="gnetman_20031226.tar.gz">gnetman_20031226.tar.gz</A>.</P>
<P>The latest version DataDraw, which is used to build data
structures for gnetman and other EDA projects is
<A HREF="datadraw_20031226.tar.gz">datadraw_20031226.tar.gz</A></P>
<P>There is a README file in the gnetman directory that explains how
to use it.  Basically, the current version supports advanced SPICE
netlisting from gschem.  The primary use so far has been for complex
IC design.  Supported features include multi-level hierarchy,
instance arrays, and <SPAN LANG="en-US">buses.</SPAN>  If you're just
doing flat designs for PC boards or spice simulations, the usual path
is to use the spice-sdb netlister for gnetlist.</P>
<P>The long term goal of gnetman is far greater.  Two projects under
consideration include a schematic generator, and a technology mapping
back-end for Icarus Verilog.  Basically, gnetman is a netlist
manipulation database well suited for low-level manipulation of
netlists.  Reality dictates that I wont be able to start on such
projects until at least March of '04.</P>
<P>If you have questions or ideas for either project, feel free to
send me e-mail at <A HREF="mailto:bill@viasic.com">bill@viasic.com</A>.
I've also been reading the geda-user mailing list from the
geda.seul.org site.</P>
