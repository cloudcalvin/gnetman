<H1>Programming in Gnetman</H1>
<P>Anyone interested in working with gnetman to create new netlist
maniputlation tools first needs to understand the datastructures.
This means working with DataDraw schemas, which is a class
diagramming tool used by gnetman.</P>

<P>Here's a quick one-liner about each class in the database schema:
<BR><BR>Root<BR>Just a name-based hash table of designs so you can
find a design given it's name.<BR><BR>Design <BR>The top level for a
hierarchical structural design.&nbsp; It has a name, and a hash table
(by name) of netlists. &nbsp;Designs point to the root netlist, and
also have a name-based hash table of Globals.&nbsp; Usually, there is
one file for a Design.  Libraries are considered as different
Designs.  Eventually, when the .INCLUDE instruction will be
supported, there will be more than one file to describe a
Design.<BR><BR>Globals<BR>Just global nets. &nbsp;Global nets have a
list of local nets in the various netlists that map to
them.&nbsp;<BR><BR>Netlist <BR>This is basically the result of one
schematic. &nbsp;There are name based hash tables of nets, instances,
and the I/O ports, called Mports (for master port). &nbsp;Mports can
be grouped into bus ports called Mbus, which are also hashed by name.
&nbsp;Nets can be grouped into Bus objects that are also hashed by
name.  In the spice world, a netlist correspond to a subckt.<BR><BR>Inst
<BR>Netlist instances, some of which represent sub-netlists.
&nbsp;Instances are inside their owning netlists, but also can have
an &quot;Internal&quot; netlist that is the sub-netlist represented
by the instance. &nbsp;Instances have doubly linked lists of their
ports.<BR><BR>Net <BR>Nets within a schematic. &nbsp;They have doubly
linked lists of their ports.<BR><BR>Port <BR>I/Os of instances. &nbsp;
These objects are used to connect instances to nets, and will always
have an owning mport that has info like the port name on it.<BR><BR>Mport
<BR>Mports (for Master port) describe the I/Os of a netlist.&nbsp;
They correspond to flag instances inside the schematic. &nbsp;A
netlist like NAND2 might have a single Mport named Z, but there can
be 10,000 instances of the NAND2. &nbsp;In this case, there will be
only one Mport for Z, and that's where the name Z is stored, along
with information like whether the port is an input or output. &nbsp;Each
of the 10,000 instances of the NAND2 will be represented with an Inst
object, and there will be a Port object on each of them corresponding
to the Z mport.<BR><BR>Bus <BR>Busses are a simple class that have an
array of nets. <BR><BR>Mbus <BR>Mbusses represent I/O busses. <BR><BR>Hier
<BR>This class is a somewhat new concept for me.&nbsp; In the past,
I've just used the netlist/inst relationships to keep track of the
hierarchy.&nbsp; The problem is that the first thing we often do is
flatten the design.&nbsp; This results in a few problems.&nbsp;
First, names get really long for large designs.&nbsp; They can use up
a large portion of the memory.&nbsp; Second, we loose the hierarchy
info, which often is needed later.&nbsp; For example, the Altera
back-end tools make good use of hierarchy, even if it's uniquified.&nbsp;
This means some poor guy has to recreate hierarchy from net names,
which is generally buggy.&nbsp; Or, perhaps we want to see the
results of synthesis, but want the gates presented in a hierarchy as
similar to the original as possible.&nbsp; Another problem is that
early on, before flattening, there's no place to put instance
attributes.&nbsp; This leads most systems to have some kind of hacked
hierarchy object anyway. <BR><BR><BR>
